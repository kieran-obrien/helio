# 🌌 Helio

<em>**Helio**</em> is a 3D solar system simulator built with Vanilla JavaScript, Vite, and WebGL (via Three.js). 

The project simulates planetary motion, allows dynamic camera control (heliocentric vs planet-follow mode), and is designed to be lightweight and interactive. The user can simulate a solar system of up to ten planets, with a range customisation options available for each planet.
> **Currently in active development**  
> Planned features include local storage support for saving planet states between sessions.
